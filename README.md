# NestJS - Understanding Dependency Injection

This is a simple project to help me to learn and understand DI in NestJS.

## Objectives

1. Allow some service to be injected with another external service by the DI Container.
2. Telling DI Container to exports some injectable class.
3. Telling DI Container to imports some modules and consume its injectable class within the module scope.
4. Consume multiple modules.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all module specs
yarn test

# Run e2e test
yarn test:e2e
```
